title: |Iterators and Generators in Python
  "Introduction to Python modules."
In python programming or any other programming language, looping over the sequence (or traversing) is the most common aspect. While loops and for loops are two loops in python that can handle most of the repeated tasks executed by programs. Iterating over sequences is so widespread that Python offers extra capabilities to make it easier and more efficient. One of the tools for traversing is Iterators and Generators in Python. This chapter kicks off our investigation of these tools. Now, letâ€™s get started with Iterators and Generators in python.

# Foo:

foo bar baz

```python
# module foo.py

a = 42

def bar(x):
    print(x)

def foo():
    return 42
```
